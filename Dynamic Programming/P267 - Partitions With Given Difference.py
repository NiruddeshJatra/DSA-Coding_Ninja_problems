# Time Complexity:
# - O(N * K), where N is the length of the array and K is (totalSum + d) / 2.
# - We iterate through each element in the array and for each element, we update O(K) states.

# Space Complexity:
# - O(K), as we use a single array of size K+1 to store the number of ways to form each sum.

# INTUITION:
# This problem asks for the number of ways to partition the array into two subsets s1 and s2 such that s1 - s2 = d.
# We can transform this problem into finding subsets with a specific sum using the following logic:
# 
# Let's denote:
# - s1 + s2 = totalSum (sum of all elements)
# - s1 - s2 = d (our target difference)
# 
# From these equations:
# s1 = (totalSum + d) / 2
# 
# So the problem reduces to finding the number of subsets with sum equal to (totalSum + d) / 2.
# 
# There's an important constraint: (totalSum + d) must be even for s1 to be an integer.
# If (totalSum + d) is odd, there can't be any valid partition.
# 
# For example, with nums = [1, 1, 2, 3] and d = 1:
# totalSum = 7, s1 = (7 + 1) / 2 = 4
# We need to find subsets with sum 4, which are [1,3] and [1,1,2]
# Therefore, there are 2 ways to partition the array with difference 1.

# ALGO:
# 1. Calculate totalSum (sum of all elements in the array).
# 2. Check if (totalSum + d) is odd. If yes, return 0 (no valid partition).
# 3. Calculate target sum k = (totalSum + d) / 2.
# 4. Initialize a DP array 'prev' of size k+1 with zeros, and set prev[0] = 1.
# 5. For each number 'num' in the array:
#    a. Skip if num > k (can't contribute to sum k)
#    b. For each possible sum 'j' from k down to num:
#       i. Update prev[j] += prev[j-num] (add the number of ways to form j-num)
# 6. Return prev[k], which represents the number of ways to form sum k.
