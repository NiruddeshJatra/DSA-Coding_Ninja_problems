# Time Complexity:
# - O(N) where N is number of nodes in the tree
# - Each node is visited exactly twice (pre-order and post-order)

# Space Complexity:
# - O(H) where H is height of tree for recursion stack
# - O(log N) for balanced tree
# - O(N) for skewed tree

# INTUITION:
# The problem requires modifying the tree such that:
# 1. Each parent should be >= sum of its children
# 2. After recursive calls, parent becomes sum of modified children
# Using pre-order + post-order traversal is optimal because:
# - Pre-order ensures parent value is adequate before processing children
# - Post-order updates parent to reflect final children values
# This two-pass approach guarantees both conditions are met

# ALGORITHM:
# Pre-order part (top-down):
# 1. Calculate sum of children
# 2. If sum > parent: update parent to sum
# 3. If sum â‰¤ parent: update children to parent value
# 4. Recurse on left and right subtrees
#
# Post-order part (bottom-up):
# 5. After recursion, recalculate sum of (modified) children
# 6. Set parent value to this sum if node has any children
